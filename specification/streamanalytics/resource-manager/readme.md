# Code Generation

## Swagger to SDK

This section describes what SDK should be generated by the automatic system.
This is not used by Autorest itself.

``` yaml $(swagger-to-sdk)
swagger-to-sdk:
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-net
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-python-track2
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-go
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-node
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-js
  - repo: azure-sdk-for-ruby
    after_scripts:
      - bundle install && rake arm:regen_all_profiles['azure_mgmt_stream_analytics']
  - repo: azure-resource-manager-schemas
    after_scripts:
      - node sdkauto_afterscript.js streamanalytics/resource-manager
```

## C#

These settings apply only when `--csharp` is specified on the command line.
Please also specify `--csharp-sdks-folder=<path to "SDKs" directory of your azure-sdk-for-net clone>`.

``` yaml $(csharp)
csharp:
  azure-arm: true
  license-header: MICROSOFT_MIT_NO_VERSION
  namespace: Microsoft.Azure.Management.StreamAnalytics
  output-folder: $(csharp-sdks-folder)/streamanalytics/Microsoft.Azure.Management.StreamAnalytics/src/Generated
  clear-output-folder: true
```

# Suppression

``` yaml

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.Input
    from: inputs.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.
    where: $.definitions.Output
    from: outputs.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R2020  # Model definition 'XXX' must have the properties 'name', 'id' and 'type' in its hierarchy and these properties must be marked as readonly.

    from: subscriptions.json
    reason: Need the “name” property to be writable on nested resources so that our RP can support a DEEP PUT scenario which at the time, ARM did not have a native way to support.

  - suppress: R3023 # Operations API must be implemented for '/providers/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/operations'.
    reason:  Operations API under 2017-04-01-preview is the super-set of all RPs operations (across all API-versions).
